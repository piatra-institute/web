                        The CPT theorem is one of the most fundamental principles in particle physics,
                        stating that all physical processes remain invariant under the combined
                        operation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T).
                        This theorem emerges from the structure of quantum field theory and special relativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While individual C, P, and T symmetries can be violated (as observed in weak
                        interactions and CP violation in kaon decay), the combined CPT symmetry
                        has never been observed to break. Any violation would have profound implications
                        for our understanding of spacetime and matter-antimatter asymmetry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This visualization explores these symmetries and their hypothetical violations,
                        showing how they might manifest in particle interactions, Feynman diagram
                        transformations, and the cosmic matter-antimatter imbalance that led to our
                        matter-dominated universe.

                            Vote No explores the often-overlooked power of rejection in democratic 
                            systems. While much attention is given to what people vote for, the 
                            dynamics of what they vote against‚Äîand why‚Äîreveal crucial insights 
                            about social movements, resistance, and democratic health.

                            This playground simulates various scenarios where &quot;no&quot; votes, abstentions, 
                            and organized resistance shape political outcomes. From referendum defeats 
                            to parliamentary opposition, the power to reject is as fundamental to 
                            democracy as the power to approve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Key concepts include: democratic resistance theory, abstention patterns, 
                            coalition building for opposition, strategic voting behavior, and the 
                            role of dissent in healthy democracies.

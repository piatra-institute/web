        content: `This level shows a basic **autogen**: a self-creating system. It has two linked processes: reciprocal catalysis and self-assembly. When enough capsid parts (gray triangles) are made, they form a shell, protecting the catalysts.

**The Sign:** Any disruption to the capsid is a sign of "non-self".

**The Interpretation:** The system's only response (the **interpretant**) is to use the released catalysts to rebuild itself. Because it responds to all disruptions in the same way, this is an **iconic** interpretationâ€”the most basic form of meaning, based on simple resemblance (a broken thing is replaced by a fixed thing).

**What to watch for:** Once the shell forms, click 'Disrupt Capsid'. Watch as the freed catalysts (blue and green circles) consume substrates (purple squares) to create new capsid parts, which then form a new shell.`
    },
    2: {
        title: 'Level 2: Indexical Interpretation',
        content: `The autogen now "senses" its environment. The capsid surface has sites where substrate molecules (purple squares) can bind. As they bind, the capsid becomes fragile.

**The Sign:** The number of bound substrates is a sign that **indicates** the concentration of "food" in the environment.

**The Interpretation:** The autogen interprets a fragile capsid not just as damage, but as a sign that it's a good time to reproduce. It breaks apart, releasing its catalysts into a resource-rich area. This is an **indexical** relationship, where the sign (fragility) is physically correlated with its object (abundant resources).

**What to watch for:** Watch the purple squares stick to the shell and see the 'Capsid Fragility' meter fill up. When it's full, the capsid will shatter, and the repair process will begin.`
    },
    3: {
        title: 'Level 3: Symbolic Interpretation',
        content: `Here, the system's "rules" are offloaded onto a separate, stable molecule: a **template** (the light gray line). Catalysts are now ineffective unless they first bind to the template in the correct sequence.

**The Sign:** The template's sequence is a **symbol**. It's an "arbitrary" code that re-presents the constraints needed for the system to function. The information has been displaced from the dynamic system onto a heritable structure, analogous to DNA.

**The Interpretation:** The system reads the template to construct new components, which then self-assemble into a **new daughter autogen**. This is a recursive, symbolic process: information is used to create a copy of the system that carries the information.

**What to watch for:** Catalysts will snap to the template. When a pair is adjacent, a reaction will flash, producing new components. Once enough capsid parts are made, they will form a new, independent autogen.`

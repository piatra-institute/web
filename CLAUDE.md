For playgrounds:

the playground must use the playground layout like the other playgrounds and must have a similar file structure, it must use the black and lime color palette like the rest of the app, if a ui component is needed check if it doesn't exist in ./components, make sure the playground is registered in the index, app/playgrounds/page.tsx
